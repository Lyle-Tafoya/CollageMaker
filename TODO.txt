This program is still in pre-alpha stage. Here is a list of things to change/add in order by priority.

1. Turn this TODO list into trackable issues on Github
2. Integrate cmake
3. There is no error checking/handling yet. I'll be adding that soon.
4. As it is now, this program only tiles left to right and top to bottom. It should also be able to from right to left or from bottom to top.
